<h4> Personal </h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Creating this site. I needed to create a personal website to showcase my projects. Each project will eventually have a detailed page to read more about the ongoing efforts.
    At the moment I am only focusing on current projects. Previous projects will be added later.
  </li>
  <li>
    Learning Haskell. I noticed that my languages were all imperative and felt that the addition of a functional language would be a nice addition.
    I'm excited to see what is possible with Haskell as even with limited knowledge it's evident this language is very powerful.
  </li>
  <li>
    Github Submitter. GUI program to assist in common git commands. The intent being to practice javafx while also fulfilling a purpose.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Research</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Program Equivalence Checker. Given two programs how do you determine if they are equivalent? Program equivalency is an undecidable problem so any breakthroughs are substantial.
    Thus far, related work focused on the compiler to ensure that optimizations were correct; we hope to generalize so that the compiler is not necessary.
  </li>
  <li>
    Spring 2016 I will begin working on a new variation of Principal Component Analysis which is focused on Natural Language Processing. This algorithm may be used for document clustering.
  </li>
</ul>
